React ChattyApp
=====================

Hello fellow humans, welcome to my chatter app, where you can now talk to yourself for only 99.99 a month!

### Let's get started

Clone the project into your git repository using ```git clone <COPY LINK TO REPO> <FOLDER NAME>```

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
```

In the main project folder, run ```npm start``` to run the webserver
In *chatty_server* run ```npm start``` to run the websocket
Now you are good to go!

### Static Files

You can store static files like images, fonts, etc in the `build` folder.

For example, if you copy a file called my_image.png into the build folder you can access it using `http://localhost:3000/build/my_image.png`.

```
npm run lint
